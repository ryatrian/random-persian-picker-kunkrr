[{"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Prompt for Building a \"Random Text Picker\" Web App\r\nPrimary Goal:\r\nCreate a simple, user-friendly web application that allows users to upload an Excel file and then randomly pick and copy unique text entries from it, one by one. The app should be designed specifically for Persian-speaking users.\r\nCore Features & User Flow:\r\nFile Upload:\r\nWhen the user first opens the app, they should be prompted to upload an Excel file.\r\nThe app should read all the text from the first column of the Excel sheet. It should ignore empty cells and any duplicate entries.\r\nRandom Text Selection:\r\nThere should be a primary button, like \"Copy Next Text.\"\r\nWhen the user clicks this button, the app randomly selects one text from the list of available texts.\r\nThis selected text is automatically copied to the user's clipboard.\r\nThe selected text is also displayed clearly on the screen.\r\nCrucially, once a text is selected, it should be removed from the pool so it cannot be chosen again.\r\nProgress Tracking:\r\nThe app must show the user's progress. Display a progress bar and a count, such as \"15 of 100 texts used,\" to show how many unique texts have been copied.\r\nUser Feedback:\r\nAfter a text is successfully copied, a small, temporary notification like \"Copied!\" should appear.\r\nIf there are any problems (e.g., the uploaded file is empty or in the wrong format), display a clear error message.\r\nAdding More Texts:\r\nThe user should have an option to upload another Excel file to add more texts to the existing list. The app should automatically handle duplicates and only add new, unique texts.\r\nWhatsApp Integration:\r\nAfter a text has been copied, a \"Send on WhatsApp\" button should appear.\r\nClicking this button should open WhatsApp in a new tab, with a pre-filled message containing the just-copied text, ready to be sent to a predefined contact number.\r\nReset Functionality:\r\nProvide a \"Reset\" button. When clicked, it should make all the texts available to be picked again.\r\nTo prevent accidental resets, show a confirmation pop-up. The user must type the word \"Reset\" into a text box to confirm the action.\r\nPersistence:\r\nThe app should remember the user's progress. If they close the browser and come back later, the list of texts and their progress should be just as they left it.\r\nDesign and User Experience:\r\nLayout: The design must be clean, modern, and centered on the screen. It should be fully responsive, looking great on both mobile phones and desktop computers.\r\nLanguage and Direction: The entire user interface, including all buttons and messages, must be in Persian. The layout must be Right-to-Left (RTL) to correctly support the Persian language.\r\nDark Mode: The app should automatically switch between a light and dark theme based on the user's system settings.\r\nVisuals: Use simple, clear icons for actions like \"copy,\" \"reset,\" \"upload,\" and \"WhatsApp.\""}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Okay, I understand the requirements for the \"Random Text Picker\" app tailored for Persian-speaking users. Here's a plan to implement the features you've described using React Native and Expo:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n-   **File Upload and Text Extraction:** Implement the file upload functionality to read text from Excel files, focusing on the first column, removing duplicates, and handling errors.\n-   **Random Text Selection and Copy:** Develop the core logic for random text selection, copying to clipboard, and removing selected texts from the pool.\n-   **Progress Tracking:** Implement the progress bar and text counter to show the user's progress.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n-   **Colors:**\n    -   Background: `#F9FAFB` (Very light gray for a clean look)\n    -   Text: `#1F2937` (Dark gray for readability)\n    -   TextSecondary: `#6B7280` (Medium gray for less important text)\n    -   Primary: `#3B82F6` (Blue for main interactive elements)\n    -   Secondary: `#6366F1` (Indigo as a complementary color)\n    -   Accent: `#22C55E` (Green for success notifications)\n    -   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White for card backgrounds)\n    -   Highlight: `#E0E7FF` (Light blue for highlighting selected elements)\n-   **Typography:** Use the \"Vazirmatn\" font for a modern and readable Persian text experience.\n\n**Implementation Plan:**\n\n1.  **Project Setup:** No changes needed here, assuming the base project is already set up.\n2.  **UI Components:**\n    -   Create a new component for file uploading.\n    -   Create a new component for displaying the selected text and the \"Copy Next Text\" button.\n    -   Create a new component for the progress bar and counter.\n    -   Create a new component for the \"Send on WhatsApp\" button.\n    -   Create a new component for the \"Reset\" button with confirmation.\n3.  **Core Logic:**\n    -   Implement the Excel file parsing logic using a library like `xlsx`.\n    -   Implement the random text selection and copy-to-clipboard functionality using `Clipboard` from `expo-clipboard`.\n    -   Implement the progress tracking logic.\n    -   Implement the WhatsApp integration using `Linking` from `react-native`.\n    -   Implement the reset functionality with confirmation.\n4.  **Persistence:**\n    -   Use `AsyncStorage` from `react-native` to persist the list of texts and the user's progress.\n5.  **Localization and RTL Layout:**\n    -   Set the app's locale to Persian.\n    -   Use `I18nManager` from `react-native` to enable RTL layout.\n6.  **Dark Mode:**\n    -   Use `useColorScheme` from `react-native` to detect the system's color scheme and apply the appropriate theme.\n7.  **Error Handling:**\n    -   Implement error handling for file uploads, text selection, and other operations.\n8.  **Modify app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx:**\n    -   Remove the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx.\n\nNow, I'll instruct the coding agent to implement the plan.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-02T08:34:36.927892"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create a \"Random Text Picker\" app for Persian-speaking users.
